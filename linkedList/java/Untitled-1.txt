Api -> Retrofit impl
Database -> Room

Task Entity:- id: String, title: String: status:[inp,completed, inb], duedate: Date, isSynced: Boolean, uploadTIme: Date

requested from ui -> Usecase(offline+api) -> offile data call first (while the online data is pulled)
if offline data is empty -> emptystate (some issue with internet)
as soon as api data is available -> update the local data with api data -> refetch the data from db (if there are any changes in local data after api is called)
above we talked about read
create req -> update localdb first -> call for api 
-> if api fails isSynced = false (in case of failure we would need retry mechanism)

isSynced -> flag: boolean, list<Objects> [(title, value)]

object-> field -> changeddata
